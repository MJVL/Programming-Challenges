Write a program that accepts a year as input and outputs the century the year belongs in (e.g. 18th century's year ranges are 1701 to 1800) and whether or not the year is a leap year. Pseudocode for leap year can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm).

Sample run:
```
Enter Year: 1996
Century: 20
Leap Year: Yes
Enter Year: 1900
Century: 19
Leap Year: No
```
